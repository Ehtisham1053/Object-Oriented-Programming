        "### üìò What is Encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  \n",
        "It refers to the **bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions)** that operate on that data into a single unit (class), while **restricting direct access to some of the object‚Äôs components**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main goal of encapsulation is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hide internal implementation details**\n",
        "- **Protect object integrity by preventing unintended interference**\n",
        "- **Provide controlled access via getter and setter methods**\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### üîë Key Concepts of Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Public Members:**\n",
        "   - Can be accessed from anywhere (inside or outside the class).\n",
        "   - In Python: any variable or method not prefixed with an underscore.\n",
        "   - Example: `self.name`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Protected Members:**\n",
        "   - Should not be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "   - Indicated by a single underscore (`_`) before the variable name.\n",
        "   - Example: `self._salary`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Private Members:**\n",
        "   - Cannot be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
        "   - Indicated by a double underscore (`__`) before the variable name.\n",
        "   - Example: `self.__bank_account`\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### üß† Why Use Encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "- ‚úÖ To **restrict access** to critical parts of the code\n",
        "- ‚úÖ To avoid accidental modifications\n",
        "- ‚úÖ To provide a **clean interface** to interact with data\n",
        "- ‚úÖ To support **data hiding** (especially sensitive data)\n",

        "\n",
        "### üõ†Ô∏è Accessing Private and Protected Members\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses **name mangling** to access private members.  \n",
        "Example: A private variable `__x` becomes `_ClassName__x` internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's considered **bad practice** to access private data like this.  \n",
        "Use getter/setter methods instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "| Private     | `__var`        | Class only (via name mangling) | `self.__balance` |\n",
